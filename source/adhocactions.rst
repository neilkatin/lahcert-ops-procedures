Ad Hoc Actions
===============

Concept
----------

The major goal for scripting our pre-plannable actions is to free up time and attention for un-planned activities.

One of the key responsibility of the Operations Section is to collect, prioritize, dispatch, and analyze these tasks.

There's no way to predict the particular tasks that might come up, but we can at least try to prepare for how to dispatch and track status of those tasks.

There are several ways Ops might receive a task: from the IC, from an incident report, from the town EOC, etc.

Ops needs to work with the IC to set priorities, and then send task requests out.  If the assignment is to be performed by
a field team the assignment should be sent to the Recon team.

Procedures
------------

The Ops team should send the new task assignment to the Recon team for assignment (with a copy to Planning/Scribe).  Recon should make an entry on the Ad Hoc
tracking form and assign a team to perform the task.

Here is additional background on non-timstamp form fields:

* **Request Time and Date**: when the form is filled by Ops
* **Request Id**: unique identifier from ops; typically a monotonically increasing integer
* **Task Priority**: importance of this task relative to others in the queue:

  * **1**: highest priority; should preempt existing assignments
  * **2**: don't preempt an existing survey, but assign before starting new preplanned surveys.
  * **3**: same priority as preplanned surveys; do when convenient
  * **4**: lower priority than preplanned surveys

* **Linked Incident**: If this task is to address a received incident report: put the incident id in this filed and attach a copy of the report.
* **Task Description**: enough background of the request so the field team can accomplish the task
* **Recon Notes**: Any progress notes needed, or results to report back to Ops

Once the task is complete the Recon team should return a copy of the completed Ops Assignment form to the Ops team and Planning/Scribe
