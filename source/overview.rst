Lessons Learned
------------------------

We've done many drills over the years.  We have two main presponsibilities:

* survey the town, both critical infrastructure and streets and houses
* respond to ad-hoc requests from others

In previous drills we have gotten bogged down in communcation and tracking.
We've made incremental improvements over time.

The insight for this "increment" of change is to pre-script our "normal" tasks to lower the communcations and tracking burden,
freeing more planning bandwidth for ad-hoc requests.

We've developped some key tools to help with this.

Critical Infrastructure
------------------------

We have on the order of 60 locations of key interest to the town (water tanks, bridges,
overpasses, electrical substations, pumping stations, schools, etc).  These locations
are called "Critical Infrastructure".  We've grouped these locations into five 'routes'
roughtly divided by geographic location.

The intent is to assign teams to survey this infrastructure by assiging routes to teams
as the teams become available.

Zone Survey
-------------

The town (plus associated unincorporated areas) have been divided up into roughly 55 "zones".
It takes 15-30 minutes for an experienced team to survey a zone; we found the overhead of communciating new assignments took so much
time we didn't have time to deal with other issues.

We grouped the zones together in to 16 nearby "groups" for assignment; this lowed the amount of overhead communcations greatly while
still being small enough to not take too long to survey.


Recon Assignment Sheet
-----------------------

To facility organizing and tracking communcation we developed a "Recon Assignment Tracking" spreadsheet.  This document has two sheets in it:
One sheet for all the pre-planned activities, and one sheet for Ad Hoc assignments.

The basic concept is these tracking sheets can be pre-printed (or printed at the beginning of a response) and then copied and distributed.
The combination of the Pre-planned and Ad Hoc status sheets should give a complete picture of the status of the response.

The current Recon Assignment Sheet is available on the `Proceedures and Documentation page`_ of the LAHCERT web site.
