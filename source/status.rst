====================
Status Reporting
====================

Concept
----------

The unifying theme of this documentation procedure is to make it easy to give updates on the Recon field status to interested
parties by distributing the Preplanned and Ad Hoc status sheets.

Recon should periodically (approx every 30 minutes, or as otherwise instructed) update, copy and distribute the Replanned and Ad Hoc status sheets.
The default distribution should be Ops, Planning/Scribe, IC, and one for Recon's records.  Since the updates will look similar be sure to put
a sequence number and timestamp on the sheets before distributing (these are the fields on the top row of the sheet)
