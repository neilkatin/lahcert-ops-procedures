Pre-planned Actions
============================

Concept
---------

The concept of the pre-planned actions is that we know we have to do these tasks sooner or later,
and having them on a predefined list makes it clear what task to assign next, and easier to track progress against the task list.

The operating procedure is for the Recon team to assign new tasks to idle groups already in the field,
without needing to check with Ops.

Actual procedure
-------------------

Each time a Recon team reports it is available for a new assignment, and there are no emergency Ad Hoc assignments pending, the Ark team should pick the next item from the pre-planned task list.

The task assignment model should be:

* Critical Infrastructure surveys
* A new assignment near the team's current location. Either:
    * a zone group survey
    * lower priority ad hoc assignments

To ease finding a nearby assignment: the pre-planned tasks are divided up into four geographic groupings: N, S, E, W, with four zone groups in each grouping.

The assignment sheet has these columns:

* **ID**: a short identifier for the pre-planned region.  E.G. "CI 2" or "ZG S4" (meaning Critical Infrastructure Route 2 or Zone Group South 4)
* **Area**: the Zone numbers that correspond to that zone group
* **Assigned To**: The recon group doing the survey.  To be filled in upon initial assignment
* **Started At**: timestamp for when the assignment was made, use four digit 24 hour time
* **Status 1,2,3**: timestamp for tracking health and welfare checks before survey completion
* **Completed At**: filled in when the task is complete

One goal for this system is to be able to tell the status of our pre-planned actions "at a glance" by looking at this sheet.
