Pre-planned Actions
============================

Concept
---------

The basic concept of the pre-planned actions is: we know we have to do these tasks sooner or later;
having them on a list makes it extremely easy to assign new tasks to unassigned groups.

The basic operating procedure is for the Recon team to assign new tasks to idle groups already in the field,
without needing to check with Ops.

Actual procedure
-------------------

Each time a Recon team reports it is available for a new assignment, and there are no Ad Hoc assignments, the HQ team should pick a free item from the preplanned list.

The basic model should be:

* Critical Infrastructure first
* A new assignment nearby the team's current location

To ease finding a nearby assignment: the pre-planned tasks are divided up into four geographic groupings: N, S, E, W, with four zone groups in each grouping.

The assignment sheet has these columns:

* **ID**: a short identifier for the pre-planned region.  E.G. "CI 2" or "ZG S4"
* **Area**: the Zone numbers that correspond to that zone group
* **Assigned To**: The recon group doing the survey.  To be filled in upon initial assignment
* **Started At**: timestamp for when the assignment was made, use four digit 24 hour time
* **Status 1,2,3**: timestamp for tracking health and welfare checks before survey completion
* **Completed At**: filled in when the task is complete

One goal for this system is to be able to tell the status of our pre-planned actions "at a glance" by looking at this sheet.
