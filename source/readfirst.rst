What is this document?
----------------------

This document describes the processes we use with the Los Altos Hills CERT (Community Emergency Response Team) program.
It gives a detailed view of how the operations section is structured, with a focus on priorities, documentation, and communicating status
between groups.

It does not focus on individual positions;
there is a separate guide that outlines each positions responsibilities.


We encourage everyone to become familiar with the whole process: it will make your individual steps make more sense,
and in an emergency you never know who may need to step into a leadership role.

But first timers should focus on the individuals chapter of the LAH CERT Position guide.  All our procedures are available online
in the `Procedures and Documentation page`_ of the `LAHCERT Web Site`_.
